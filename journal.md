## To Do

How sensitive is the inverse FT to noise in the phase data? What about noise in intensities?

What should we use for training data? Lattices? Random images? Images from a database?

Can a neural net learn to do inverse fourier transforms? What is possible without phase information?

What is the appropriate size and structure of a neural neural net for our problem?
